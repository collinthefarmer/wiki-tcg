- rarity based off of page views? or content-to-view ratio?
    - rarity informs quality of AI output
        - weaker, more common cards get summarized with an angry or belittling tone
        - would also get less nice NOUNs and ADJECTIVES
- give credit to most contributing editor
- cards have a "vintage" based on the revision they were generated in
    - store cards with a vintage key to still allow for caching


- build out a set of different card frames to handle common thumbnail aspect ratios
    - and map cards to frames based on the AR of their thumbnails


- NOUNs and ADJECTIVES:
    - impact card visuals
    - noun -> card shape/outline texture
    - adjs -> card interior texture


- RARITY
    - interact with noun/adjective patterns


- GAMEPLAY:
    - fundamentally it's War
    - players take turns laying down cards
    - highest view count/edit count?/content length? wins




idea requirements
    - map all nouns/adjectives to display patterns

    - API to access page metadata
        - most contributing editor
        - page views
        - content length
        - number of related pages?



PLAN

Adjust Backend

- nginx reverse proxy/load balancing

Adjust APIs

- clean up and secure backend
- error handling, logging

Build New APIs

- deck storage
    - store to local file
    - load using site

Front End

- rebuild card layout
    - multiple layouts for thumbnail variants
- allow for noun/adj patterns
- rarity effects



-- CONCEPT

CARDS
cards' subjects are chosen randomly from all english wikipedia articles
cards are uniquely identified by their canonical title and revision number
cards have:
    a power level determined by the page views/edit count of their source article
    card art from thumbnail
    AI generated flavor text or quote about them from (a made-up character's) perspective
    AI selected classification constructed from choices of noun/adjective sets
    card decoration determined by noun/adjective choices
cards are generated only once per title/revision

GAMEPLAY
users each draw 1 hand of 7 cards
users take turns laying down cards until all players have
highest value card laid wins, winner takes pot
start new hand
after n hands, or only one player has cards, game is over
users can opt to save their decks to a local file
